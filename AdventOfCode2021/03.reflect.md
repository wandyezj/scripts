# Reflect

- keep code organized divide into helper functions quickly
- use names that correspond to the problem to keep things simple
- go for speed not the most elegant solution
- performance doesn't matter too much for < 1000 values don't worry about it
- consider writing a simple version to better solve similar problems in the future
- avoid numbers in variable names
- beware of order
- get familiar with python array filter function and lambda
- get familiar with python bit manipulation
