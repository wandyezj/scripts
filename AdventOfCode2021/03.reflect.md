# Reflect

- keep code organized divide into helper functions quickly
- use names that correspond to the problem to keep things simple
- go for speed not the most elegant solution
- performance doesn't matter too much for < 1000 values don't worry about it
- consider writing a simple version to better solve similar problems in the future
- avoid numbers in variable names
- beware of order
- get familiar with python array filter function and lambda
- get familiar with python bit manipulation
- dont need to count zeros and ones can just count one and subtract from total number
- o and 0 look familar to each other and its easy to get confused, so spell it out

## Helpful Functionality

Convert string of zeros and ones to decimal number `int(value, 2)`

Ternary: `"1" if x == "0" else "0"`

Map: `list(map(lambda x: x, original)))`

Filter: `list(filter(lambda x: x, original))`
