# Reflect

- convert to ints up front to skip later conversion
    - ugly:`print(sum(map(to_numbers, unmarked)) * int(win))`
- not necessary to mark things in memory if can simply be recalculated and reconstructed
- can string slice instead of append to build set if iterating through
- breaking up into smaller function blocks is definitely helpful
