# Reflect

- convert to ints up front to skip later conversion
    - ugly:`print(sum(map(to_numbers, unmarked)) * int(win))`
- not necessary to mark things in memory if can simply be recalculated and reconstructed
- can string slice instead of append to build set if iterating through
- breaking up into smaller function blocks is definitely helpful
- might be convenient to have command line option to swap to real input
- simply have a run command that selects the current selected day
- automatically add in reflect to learn.md
- start with full data read
- could have done `split("\n\n")`
- don't hesitate decide and go
- don't worry about debugging code has to be right the first time
- don't worry about edge cases for programming competition
